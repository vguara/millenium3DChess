Standard Chess Notation Basics:

Files (columns) are labeled a to h.

Ranks (rows) are numbered 1 to 8.

Each square is identified by its file letter followed by its rank number (e.g., e4, d5).

Pieces are represented by their initials:

King: K

Queen: Q

Rook: R

Bishop: B

Knight: N

Pawn: P

Moves are written as:

Piece initial + destination square (e.g., Nf3 for a knight moving to f3).

Captures are indicated with an x (e.g., Bxe5 for a bishop capturing on e5).

Special symbols: + for check, # for checkmate, 0-0 for kingside castling, and 0-0-0 for queenside castling.
